            DETECTION - 
            Collection of detected faces, where each face is represented as a detection proto message that contains 
            a bounding box and 6 key points (right eye, left eye, nose tip, mouth center, right ear tragion, and left
            ear tragion). The bounding box is composed of xmin and width (both normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the
            image width) and ymin and height (both normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image height). Each key point
            is composed of x and y, which are normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width and height
            respectively.
